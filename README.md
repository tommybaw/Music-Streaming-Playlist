# Music-Streaming-Playlist

The purpose of this project is to create a music selection engine that will choose artists for users to listen to based on
their age and gender.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is the curiosity to apply linear optimization to real world data, which can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/MusicHackathon. 

Although we didn't accomplish the task asked by Kaggle, we based this around requirements surrounding a master's level OPR course.

This was completed using SAS, Excel, and Access.
